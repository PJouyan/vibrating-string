# vibrating-string
### Simulation of a clamped string's vibrations and sound by means of numerical methods in Python.

The method and its implementation are found in "vibrating-string-functions.py" and an example simulation exists in "vibrating-string-simulation-1.py".
By running the latter, an mp4 and two wav files (similar to the existing ones in the repository) will be generated.

In case of any issues, questions or suggestions, please email me.
