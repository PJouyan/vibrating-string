# vibrating-string
### Simulation of an (ideal or stiff) clamped string's vibrations and sound by means of numerical methods in Python

The method and its implementation is in "vibrating_string_functions.py" and an example simulation exists in "vibrating_string_simulation_1.py".
By running the latter, an mp4 and a wav file (similar to the existing ones in the repository) will be generated, which can then be combined.

The codes in their current state are the first draft and not documented well yet. They will be improved.

In case of any issues, questions or suggestions, please email me.
